A [Sublime Text 2/3](http://www.sublimetext.com/) / [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) bundle for [Volt](http://docs.phalconphp.com/en/latest/reference/volt.html)

Installation via Package Control (Sublime)
------------
> This is the recommended installation method.

If you have Sublime Package Control, you know what to do. If not, well: it's a package manager for Sublime Text; it's awesome and you can [read about it here](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control) to install.

After installing the package and restarting the editor:

* Open the Command Pallete (`ctrl+shift+P` or `cmd+shift+P`).
* Type "Install Package" and hit return.
* Type "Volt" and hit return.
